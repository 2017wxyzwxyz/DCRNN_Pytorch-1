# DCRNN_Pytorch
 A Simplified Pytorch implementation of the Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Yaguang Li, Rose Yu, Cyrus Shahabi, Yan Liu, [Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network: Data-Driven Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01926), ICLR 2018.

This repo is self-implemented under the help of the original [tensorflow implementaion](<https://github.com/liyaguang/DCRNN>) and a [third party pytorch implementation](<https://github.com/xlwang233/pytorch-DCRNN>). The motivation of this implementation is to build a simple and user-friendly reference for learners and practitioners in the Graph-based Spatial-Temporal data mining area.

If you are interested in the area, you could further check our paper about passenger demand forecasting:   ["STG2Seq: Spatial-temporal Graph to Sequence Model for Multi-step Passenger Demand Forecasting"](<https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/0274.pdf>)
